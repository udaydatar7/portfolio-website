Uncertainty arising from both global factors and the trajectory of the pandemic influenced RBI’s monetary policy committee (MPC) meeting this month. MPC’s minutes point to the growing complexity in economic policy making and the need for synchronisation of monetary and fiscal policies to insulate the economy from uncertainty and also provide policy support to an underperforming economy.  Consequently, there’s unanimity in the committee that the policy interest rate needs to be kept at the current 4%.

A sharp rise in inflation across many countries is the root cause for uncertainty stemming from global factors. This is expected to play out in India too, with RBI projecting average inflation in the January-March quarter to be around 5.7%, a level above the forecast of 5.3% for 2021-22. Supply disruptions as economies normalise and a rise in commodity prices, especially crude, pose the biggest challenge in India’s inflation scenario. RBI’s challenge in this scenario is that while it has to deal with both domestic inflation and the possible turbulence in financial markets as major central banks adjust their policies, it also has to provide monetary support to economic revival. The MPC’s minutes show the committee is not yet convinced that the revival seen in the July-September quarter is durable.

The economic scenario calls for close coordination between monetary and fiscal authorities. So far, India’s approach has been to let monetary policy based on surplus liquidity and a low policy rate provide the primary boost for the economy. However, uncertainty usually catalyses risk aversion among banks. Therefore, fiscal policy may have to plug the gaps in some contact-intensive sectors that haven’t yet recovered. As states have begun tightening some restrictions to deal with Omicron, GoI may have to calibrate fiscal policy in the forthcoming budget to complement monetary policy. This will also provide RBI space to limit any turbulence on account of global uncertainty.
